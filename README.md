# Scope 3 Athletics Emissions Scraper
Emma Strawbridge co 2025, Amherst College Statistics and Sustainability Departments

- **GOAL OF PROJECT**

The goal for this project was to find a way to scrape and use existing schedule data from the Amherst College athletics website to estimate the carbon emissions generated by athletic travel in a given year. While some information in these files is specific to Amherst College -- transportation type, distances, and roster size -- the general method can be used for most (but not all) NCAA schools. 

- **INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE**

To use or modify this code, your school's athletic website needs to look like this:
<img width="1272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d8c0427-f357-4dec-abff-7fa40a5e6b5e">
The key here is that you have the option to download the schedule as a `.txt` file, which is what we're reading.

To get a two-year average of your school's emissions, you will need two seasons' worth of data for each team. Save that data in a data folder, and indicate which season (the first or second season of the two you picked) each schedule is from with a `1.txt` or a `2.txt` to keep it uniform. 

Then you can run pretty much everything I've written. Amherst flies to very few events, so the standard is bus data, which is easy to do. I'm adding the championship events by hand. If you have more of a sports industrial complex at your institution, you will probably need to change a large chunk of this code to accommodate for more plane travel. Any spring training trips are also added by hand and there are some corrections made as well. 

Please comment on the questions issue if you have any questions about the code (or just start a new issue, whatever is easiest) and let me know if you're using it! I'd love to hear how it goes.
